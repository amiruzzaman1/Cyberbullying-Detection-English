# Cyberbullying Detection App (English) with Streamlit GUI

## Overview

A Cyberbullying Detection App designed to identify instances of cyberbullying in English text. The app incorporates a diverse set of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including BERT, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and others.

## Key Features

- **Algorithmic Diversity:** A blend of traditional machine learning algorithms and cutting-edge deep learning models for robust cyberbullying detection.
- **Preprocessing:** Stringent text preprocessing involving tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, and removal of stop words, ensuring high-quality data for model training and assessment.
- **Feature Representation:** Varied feature representations such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and embeddings cater to different algorithmic requirements, capturing semantic connections within the text.
- **Model Performance:** A detailed classification report for the English dataset showcasing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for each algorithm.

## Dataset

The English dataset for this cyberbullying detection app employs multi-class classification, categorizing texts into four bullying categories (gender-based, age-related, religious, and ethnic) along with a "Not Bullying" class.

### Bullying Classifications:

1. **Gender-based Bullying:** Degrading words related to gender.
2. **Age-related Bullying:** Occurs in adolescent environments.
3. **Religious Bullying:** Discrimination or derision based on beliefs.
4. **Ethnic-based Bullying:** Prejudice or racial insults.
